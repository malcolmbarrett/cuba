cuba is an R package for applying quantitative bias analysis (QBA). Often, simple data problems prohibit proper inference. For instance, mismeasuring the exposure you are studying will distort the estimate your model produces. QBA allows you to use external data or assumptions to conduct sensitivity analyses and adjustments to understand how data problems, such as measurement error or missingness, affect your results. cuba takes an expressive, composable approach to specifying assumptions and validation data for use for a wide variety of problems.


cuba is under development
